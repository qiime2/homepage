An explanation of what is happening in this file and where things live.

This is an MDX file. It's markdown with a bit of JSX syntax, you may wish to
install a language pack for it for your editor. That's also why there's a weird
export statement in front of this comment.

The rest of this is Astro.

"Dynamic" data is sourced from collection loaders in:
  - src/content/config.ts
    (This is where forum posts and distros are coming from.)

URLs and Navigation should stay largely here:
  - src/navigation.ts

Config for the theme is here:
  - src/config.yaml

Colors live here:
  - src/components/CustomStyles.astro

The rest is pretty standard looking.

  title="Our users love these features"
  subtitle="The QIIME 2 Framework (Q2F) empowers researchers to conduct reproducible biological data science through a variety of interfaces and using diverse methods.">

  <FeatureItem title='Latest Methods' icon='tabler:microscope'>
QIIME 2 integrates dozens of plugins and hundreds of bioinformatics methods, allowing users to perform cutting-edge microbiome analysis with interactive visualizations and robust statistical tools.
  </FeatureItem>

  <FeatureItem title='Automated Provenance Recording' icon='tabler:history'>
All commands, parameters, and computational environments used during analysis are automatically recorded with decentralized data provenance.
This ensures full transparency and reproducibility.
With data provenance embedded as metadata in your data and visualizations, your data won't become disconnected from the details of how it was created.
  </FeatureItem>

  <FeatureItem title='Multiple Interfaces' icon='tabler:stack-2'>
All analytic functionality is available through multiple interfaces: Python 3 and R APIs for programmatic access; a command line interface (CLI) for efficient scripting, and a graphical interface (GUI) via Galaxy for an intuitive, visual experience.
Regardless of your computational background, QIIME 2 has an interface that will enable you to work efficiently!
  </FeatureItem>

  <FeatureItem title='Extensible' icon='tabler:hexagon-plus'>
Q2F is plugin-based, making it straight-forward to extend and customize the platform.
Developers can integrate their bioinformatics methods, leveraging an extensive library of existing functionality and leaving the interfaces and provenance recording to the framework.
  </FeatureItem>

  <FeatureItem title='Accessible' icon='tabler:book-2'>
QIIME 2 is designed to be accessible to all users, from students to seasoned researchers.
It provides simplified workflows, comprehensive tutorials, and clear documentation to streamline microbiome analysis.
Visit the [QIIME 2 Library](https://library.qiime2.org) for guides, tutorials, and reference materials.
  </FeatureItem>

  <FeatureItem title='Open Source Community' icon='tabler:users'>
QIIME 2 thrives because of its community, which drives the direction of the project.
The [QIIME 2 Forum](https://forum.qiime2.org) is the hub of the community, and serves as a free resource for discussions, troubleshooting, and collaboration.
Users are encouraged to engage and share their insights.
You can learn about our expectations of community members in the [code of conduct](https://github.com/qiime2/.github/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

    classes={{ container: '' }}>

  <FAQItem title='How do I pronounce QIIME 2?'>
QIIME 2 is pronounced "chime two". üîî
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem title='Is QIIME 2 free to use?'>
Yes!
QIIME 2 is completely free and open source, meaning anyone can use, modify, and contribute to its development under our [BSD 3-Clause License](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/blob/dev/LICENSE).
That includes commercial use.
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem title='How do I start using QIIME 2?'>
* If you have QIIME 2 results and want to interact with them without installing QIIME 2, use [QIIME 2 View](https://view.qiime2.org).
* If you want to install and use QIIME 2 on your own system, follow the [installation guide](https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.10/install/).

To learn marker gene (i.e., amplicon) analysis with QIIME 2, see the [amplicon docs](https://amplicon-docs.readthedocs.io).
To learn metagenome (i.e., shotgun) analysis with QIIME 2, see the [MOSHPIT docs](https://moshpit-docs.readthedocs.io).
To learn advanced techniques for working with the QIIME 2 Framework, see [*Using QIIME 2*](https://use.qiime2.org).
As of March 2025, we're doing an extensive re-write of our documentation using [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) to modernize it and to improve organization and accessibility.
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem title='What the heck is a .qza (or .qzv) file?'>
They're literally just .zip files, with a different file extension that means *QIIME Zipped Artifact* or *QIIME Zipped Visualization*.
You can open them with any unzip utility, such as `unzip` or 7zip.

We call these "archives", and they contain your data in the normal formats (`.fastq.gz`, `.fasta`, `.biom`, ...) alongside some QIIME 2 specific metadata, like your data's provenance.
You can learn about the archive format [here](https://develop.qiime2.org/en/latest/framework/references/archive-versions.html).
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem title='How can I get help or become involved with the QIIME 2 community?'>
The [QIIME 2 Forum](https://forum.qiime2.org) is the primary resource for support and community interaction.
There you can find announcements, job postings, and technical assistance from a vibrant and active microbiome data science community.

If you're not a software developer and want to get involved in the project, see [*How to get Involved in the QIIME 2 Community*](https://use.qiime2.org/en/latest/how-to-guides/get-involved.html).
If you are a developer and want to get involved in the project, see [our *Contributing Guide*](https://github.com/qiime2/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem title='What do you mean by "AI-Ready"?'>
We mean that you'll always know how the QIIME 2 Artifacts that you're working with were generated (because of Q2F's data provenance recording), and that the steps performed to create them made logical sense (because of Q2F's Artifact Class system).
We now also working on functionality that allows users to sign and add a license to their data, so you'll always know if or how it can be used.

Garbage In, Garbage Out. Artifacts In, Actual Intelligence Out.‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem title='Can I develop my own QIIME 2 plugins?'>
Yes!
[*Developing with QIIME 2*](https://develop.qiime2.org), a free online book by Evan Bolyen and Greg Caporaso, provides resources for plugin development, including a step-by-step tutorial for building plugins from scratch.
The QIIME 2 Library is also continuously updated with community contributions, and when you're ready we encourage you to share your plugin there so it can be discovered by others.
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem title='Where can I find more QIIME 2 plugins?'>
The [QIIME 2 Library](https://library.qiime2.org) hosts a variety of plugins and tools developed by the community, expanding QIIME 2‚Äôs capabilities beyond its base distributions.
